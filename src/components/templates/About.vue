                        Hi, I'm angel. I'm currently studying my last year of engineering in software development at
                         the Autonomous University of Baja California Sur. I like the challenges that being a developer entails, 
                         finding solutions and even more, being able to overcome them.
                         I like front-end development and I'm good at it, but I find the back-end even more interesting.
